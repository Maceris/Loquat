# Loquat

Loquat is a rendering engine written in Vulkan.

The PBR portion is based on pbrt v4.

## Building
To create the project or solution files for the project, you can run `regenerate-project.bat` or `regenerate-project.sh`. 
This will generate all of the project files in the `bin` folder. These can be rerun to wipe out the whole bin directory
again and regenerate the project contents.

If using Visual Studio, you can open the Loquat solution and build and run it from there.
